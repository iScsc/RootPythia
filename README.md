## API Root-me

**Info about the API**

A firewall makes us safe against Deny of Service attacks, banishing every IP address that :
- initiates more than 25 connections per second
- maintains more than 25 TCP connections simultaneously

This banishment is temporary and lasts only 5 minutes. Donâ€™t try to connect to our services during ban time or it will be extended.
